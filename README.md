# Simple rEFInd Theme

[rEFInd][refind] is an easy to use boot manager for UEFI based systems. This is a simple theme for it.
It comes in a light and dark variant and is based on the rEFInd-minimal theme from [Evan Purkhiser][refind-minimal] and rEFInd-minimal-dark
theme from [Carlos Pinto][refind-minimal-dark].

The function icons are based on those of the rEFInd-regular theme from [Alberto Bursi][refind-regular].
